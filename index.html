    <H1>Before anything try speaking to someone (Resource: 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline)</H1>
    <p id="metadata">"I hear you. That sounds really heavy, and I’m sorry you’ve been carrying that. I’m not here to fix everything for you, but I can listen and help figure out what might make things feel a bit lighter."

(If you seem uncertain about what’s going on)
"It’s okay to not have all the answers about how you feel. Sometimes just talking things out can help bring a bit of clarity."

(If it feels like things are overwhelming)
"Would it feel okay if we looked into some extra support together — like talking to a counselor or helpline? I can help you find one and even sit with you while you call or message them."

(Always reinforcing)
"You matter to me, and I’m not going anywhere. We can take things one small step at a time — you don’t have to do this alone."
Acknowledge your feelings without judgment

It’s okay to feel sad, anxious, or unmotivated. You don’t need to “earn” the right to feel the way you do.

Break things into smaller steps

Instead of “I need to clean the whole house,” start with “I’ll pick up the clothes in one corner of the room.” Small wins build momentum.

Establish a gentle routine

Keep it flexible, but try to get up, eat, and sleep at roughly the same times each day. Structure helps stabilize mood.

Move your body in a way that feels kind

A short walk, light stretching, or dancing to a favorite song can release tension without feeling like a chore.

Stay connected — even if it’s low effort

A quick text, voice message, or coffee with a friend can counter feelings of isolation.

Limit doom-scrolling

Give yourself media-free breaks to reduce stress and overstimulation.

Practice grounding techniques

Try the “5-4-3-2-1” method: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. It can help during anxiety spikes.

Seek professional help early

Therapists, counselors, or support groups can provide tools you might not discover on your own.

Be patient with your progress

Healing is rarely a straight line — some days will feel better, others harder. That’s normal.

Remind yourself you’re not alone

Many people experience mental health struggles, and support exists — from hotlines like 988 (U.S.) to community groups and online resources.
